"""
Create 'process_file()' to extract the flight data from that table as a list of
dictionaries, each dictionary containing relevant data from the file and table
row. This is an example of the data structure you should return:

data = [{"courier": "FL",
         "airport": "ATL",
         "year": 2012,
         "month": 12,
         "flights": {"domestic": 100,
                     "international": 100}
        },
         {"courier": "..."}
]

Note - year, month, and the flight data should be integers.
You should skip the rows that contain the TOTAL data for a year.
